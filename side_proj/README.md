#### Pipeline steps for calling SNPs (and indels) in stick insects are described in :


* [**A - raw data formatting**](./A_raw_reads)

  Organising / merging / renaming fastq files of the five resequenced individuals in the ten species.

* [**B - read trimming**](./B_cleaned_reads)

  Trimming of the reads for quality and presence of adapters.

* [**C - mapping**](./C_mapping)

* [**D - snp calling (preliminary round)**](./D_snp_calling_round0)

* [**E - base quality recalibration**](./E_recalibration)

* [**F - snp calling (final round)**](./F_snp_calling_round1)
