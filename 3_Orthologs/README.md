# Orthologs

Description from the paper:

> Timema orthologous groups (OGs) were inferred with the OrthoDB standalone pipeline (v. 2.4.4) using default parameters. In short, genes are clustered with a graph-based approach based on all best reciprocal hits between each pair of genomes. The high level of fragmentation typical for Illumina-based genomes constrains the ability to identify 1:1 orthologs across all ten Timema species. To maximize the number of single copy OGs covering all ten Timema species, transcriptomes were included during orthology inference. Thus, transcripts were used to complete OGs in absence of a gene from the corresponding species. Using this approach, 7157 single copy OGs covering at least three sexual-parthenogenetic sister species pairs were obtained (SM Table 4).
